	<h1>About Code Analyzer</h1>
	<p>The code analyzer is an application that tests for java vulnerabilities. It takes code either as a snippet in the text area or via an uploaded file and analyzes it for switch vulnerabilities, static field vulnerabilities, and finalize method vulnerabilities. The application then generates a report which is sent back to the user along with the code. </p>
